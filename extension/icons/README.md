# Extension Icons

Please add the following icon files to this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create simple bookmark icons using any image editor or use placeholder images for testing.

For testing purposes, you can use a simple colored square or download free icons from:
- https://www.flaticon.com
- https://icons8.com
- https://www.iconfinder.com

Make sure the icons have a transparent background and represent a bookmark or similar concept.
